# University Campus
Network Toplogy for University Main Campus and Branch Network 

<h1> University Campus Lab </h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Description</h2>
Main Campus Setup:

In this main campus lab setup we will devise a setup for three key buildings to serve various functions.
Branch Network Integration:

Step 1 Create a branch network connected to the main campus to facilitate seamless data transfer and collaboration.
Departmental Segmentation:

Step 2 Logically separate eight distinct departments within the main campus network using Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs).
Trunk Communication Setup:

Step 3 Assign trunk ports to interfaces facing routers to enable efficient trunk communication between the main campus and branch.
Inter-VLAN Routing:

Step 4 Implement inter-VLAN routing on the main campus routers to allow for seamless communication between different departments.
VLAN Subinterfaces:

Step 5 Create VLAN subinterfaces to enhance network flexibility and scalability.
DHCP Pool Configuration:

Step 6 Configure DHCP pools for each VLAN to streamline network administration and ensure devices receive dynamic IP addresses.
Router RIP Configuration:

Step 7 Configure Routing Information Protocol (RIP) on the routers to advertise networks for both the main campus and branch, optimizing routing efficiency and data transfer.
